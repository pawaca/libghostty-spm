# Ghostty Patches

This directory is the single place for local upstream Ghostty patches used by
the `libghostty-spm` build pipeline. They target the pinned upstream commit
(`Ghostty.ref` at the repository root), not whatever upstream main is today.

## How they apply

`Script/build-ghostty.sh` runs `Script/apply-patches.sh <source_dir>` before
every Zig build, and `Script/build-platform.sh` calls it once per target, so
macOS, iOS, iOS Simulator, Mac Catalyst, visionOS, and visionOS Simulator all
build from the same patched tree. (Patches to Zig's own std live in
`../zig/`; they are staged by `Script/prepare-zig-lib.sh`, not by this
pipeline.) The script walks this directory in name order and dispatches on the
extension:

- `.patch` is a unified diff applied with `git -C <source> apply`; `git` must
  be installed (0003 carries a binary hunk `patch(1)` cannot apply), but the
  source may be a clone, a worktree or an extracted tarball. A patch that
  already reverse-applies is reported as applied and skipped; one that fails
  `--check` is retried with `git apply --3way`, which merges the hunks
  against the blobs named in the patch's `index` lines (so cut every patch
  with `git diff`, which writes them, and regenerate a patch the log says
  needed the 3-way merge); one that conflicts even then aborts the build.
- `.sh` is executed as `<script> <source_dir>`; each script checks for its
  own changes (a marker or the edited text) and skips whatever is already
  applied, so re-running it is a no-op. The newer scripts (0005's
  IOSurfaceLayer edit, 0011, 0014, 0015) make every edit through
  `Script/support/anchored_edit.py`: an edit names only the upstream text it
  depends on, that text must occur in the file exactly once, byte for byte,
  and anything else — moved is fine, changed, gone or ambiguous is not —
  stops the run with a `[-]` line naming the file and the anchor. There is
  no fuzz and no reduced context: a diff hunk breaks when unrelated code
  next to it moves, and a fuzzy match at a mutex-release site or a mode
  handler is exactly the wrong fix for that. `expect_count` tripwires guard
  the edits that have to cover every occurrence of something (0011's
  writers that release the terminal-state mutex). An edit whose own text a
  later patch rewrites (0012 and 0016 widen the `.ios` checks 0005 adds)
  names a `marker` line those leave alone, which is then what proves it is
  in place; a tree carrying an older variant of an edit has neither the
  pristine text nor the marker and is refused, never quietly kept.
- `.md` is ignored. Any other file aborts the build.

`0002-host-managed-io.patch` is skipped when upstream's header already
carries `GHOSTTY_SURFACE_IO_BACKEND_HOST_MANAGED`; every other patch here
applies unconditionally.

There are no `-vN` variants in the tree today. The pin carried four for a
while — pre-`ghostty_surface_foreground_pid` and pre-`global.environMap()`
spellings of 0002, and the pre-Zig-0.16 spellings of 0003, 0005 and 0006 —
selected by upstream API markers in `apply-patches.sh`. `Ghostty.ref` only
ever moves forward, so once the pin passed all four markers the older
spellings could not be chosen again and were dropped along with the
selection logic. `git log -- Patches/ghostty/` has them if a pin ever needs
to move back.

## Rules

- Keep patches numbered so they apply in a stable order (`0007` edits lines
  `0006` added).
- Prefer standard unified diff files (`.patch`) when the upstream context is
  stable.
- Use executable patch scripts (`.sh`) when upstream context is too unstable
  for a reliable diff — and write them with `anchored_edit.py`, not with
  bare `str.replace` calls that silently do nothing when the text moved.
- When upstream context moves under a patch, add a `-vN` variant beside it
  and select it in `Script/apply-patches.sh` with an upstream API marker — a
  grep for the code the patch touches, never a version string: a version
  test picks the wrong variant the moment the next version lands, a code
  test keeps picking the right one until that code moves again. Drop the
  superseded variant, and its marker, once the pin is past it for good.
- Preserve newer Ghostty's renamed internal-library outputs
  (`ghostty-internal.*`) when extending its Darwin static-library build path.
- Every patch in this directory must be safe to re-run: the pipeline applies
  the whole directory once per build target.
- Patches here are applied automatically by `Script/build-ghostty.sh`, so they
  affect macOS, iOS, Mac Catalyst, and visionOS builds equally.

## Patches

- `0001-darwin-libghostty-install.sh` — `build.zig`: install the header and
  static `libghostty.a` on Darwin, which upstream only wires for other OSes;
  handles both the `libghostty_*` and the renamed `lib_*` /
  `ghostty-internal` outputs.
- `0002-host-managed-io.patch` — the host-managed IO backend
  (`GHOSTTY_SURFACE_IO_BACKEND_HOST_MANAGED`, receive-buffer and resize
  callbacks, `ghostty_surface_write_buffer` / `_process_exit`,
  `src/termio/HostManaged.zig`), against a source that declares
  `ghostty_surface_foreground_pid` itself and has upstream's
  `global.environMap()` / `global.resourcesDir()` rename.
- `0003-prebuilt-framedata.patch` — commit
  `src/build/framegen/framedata.compressed` and use it instead of building and
  running the `framegen` host tool, against Zig 0.16's build API
  (`addCSourceFile` / `linkSystemLibrary` on `root_module`).
- `0004-ios-fixes.sh` — ignore cf_release_thread loop errors, stub the private
  `CGSSetWindowBackgroundBlurRadius` call (App Store), link Metal and MetalKit
  in `pkg/macos`, iOS deployment target 15.0, and turn upstream's "iOS is
  not a supported target for the full Ghostty build" refusal in
  `Config.zig` into a comptime-false branch (marker
  `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_IOS_FULL_BUILD`; skipped on a source without the guard).
- `0005-ios-metal-rendering.sh` — iOS rendering: IOSurfaceLayer on
  `CAIOSurfaceLayer` with a ±1 px tolerance for UIKit's point-to-pixel
  rounding and a rejection of anything further off — a frame sized for an
  earlier resize, which an older variant of this patch rescaled through
  `contentsScale` and thereby shifted the grid by a row on every resize —
  first-frame display and synchronous present in `Metal.zig`, no CF release
  thread in coretext on iOS, 64-byte-aligned IOSurface rows, libxev update
  for the kqueue mach-port panic. The IOSurfaceLayer edits are anchored (a
  tree carrying the older variant is refused); the rest still test for
  their own added text.
- `0006-disable-custom-shaders.sh` — `custom_shaders` build option gating
  glslang and spirv-cross (marker `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_TRIM_PATCH`).
- `0007-disable-inspector.sh` — `inspector` build option gating dcimgui
  (marker `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_INSPECTOR_DISABLE`).
- `0008-macos-metal-texture-storage.sh` — choose MTLTexture storage by GPU
  family: shared on Apple GPUs, managed on Intel and AMD. The field lives in
  `renderer/metal/Device.zig` (upstream `40d5b860d2` moved device selection
  there, shared by every renderer); `Metal.zig`'s four texture sites read it,
  its one buffer site keeps `default_storage_mode`. Anchored edits plus a
  count tripwire on those sites (marker `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_TEXTURE_STORAGE_PATCH`).
- `0009-libcxx-apple-availability.sh` — force libc++ Apple availability
  annotations in highway, simdutf, and `src/simd`, so a symbol newer than the
  deployment floor (`__libcpp_verbose_abort`) fails at compile time instead of
  in dyld at launch on iOS 15 / macOS 13.0–13.2.
- `0010-fix-scroll-remainder-zeroing.patch` — `Surface.zig`: truncate the
  scrolled row amount so the pending scroll remainder is not always zero.
- `0011-replay-response-suppression.sh` —
  `ghostty_surface_write_buffer_replay`: feed reconstructed history through
  the parser with terminal protocol responses discarded at their origin.
  Anchored edits; the two `expect_count` tripwires in `stream_handler.zig`
  pin the number of places the parser releases the terminal-state mutex
  (each must clear the suppression flag for that window), so an upstream
  that adds one fails the build instead of dropping another thread's
  message as replay.
  `apprt.surface.Message.discardIfTerminalResponse` does not cover
  `kitty_clipboard_read`/`kitty_clipboard_write` (added after this patch was
  authored) — the receiver takes ownership of a boxed request it must
  destroy, which the classifier has no way to do. Replaying reconstructed
  history containing a Kitty clipboard protocol sequence can still leak a
  confirmation to the host; low risk today (no on-disk scrollback replay uses
  this path yet) but worth closing if that changes.
- `0012-visionos.sh` — the `visionos` OS tag takes the iOS arm everywhere
  the build system and the Darwin runtime switch on it: `MetallibStep`
  learns the `xros` / `xrsimulator` SDKs and the Metal compiler's
  `-mtargetos=xros<ver>[-simulator]` flag (there is no
  `-mxros-version-min`), `Config.zig` gets a 1.0 minimum OS version, and
  `Metal.zig`, `metal/Device.zig` (the storage-mode and `chooseDevice`
  arms), `IOSurfaceLayer.zig`, `coretext.zig`, `pty.zig` (NullPty),
  `os/{desktop,homedir,open}.zig`, `config/theme.zig`, `input/keycodes.zig`,
  `cli/tui.zig`, `Command.zig`, and `pkg/apple-sdk` each get `.visionos`
  beside `.ios` (marker `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_VISIONOS_PATCH`). Needs the Zig std
  patch in `../zig/` as well.
- `0013-host-toolchain.sh` — two host-side fixes that hold for every target:
  `LibtoolStep` merges archives with `zig ar --format=darwin` (Xcode 27's
  libtool silently drops Zig's 2-byte-aligned members — oniguruma, libintl,
  freetype, simd — and only the consuming app's link notices; marker
  `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_ZIG_AR_PATCH`), and `libghostty-vt.dylib` is no longer
  installed (nothing ships it, and its libc++ sub-compile is what fails
  under Xcode 27 and on visionOS everywhere; marker
  `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_NO_VT_DYLIB`).
- `0014-preserve-sync-on-resize.sh` — keep DEC 2026 synchronized output
  active across a resize. A TUI that clears and repaints inside one sync
  transaction must not expose its empty intermediate grid when the resize
  arrives. The existing termio timer still ends a transaction after one
  second if the program fails to do so. Two anchored edits: `Terminal.resize`
  no longer clears the mode, and libghostty-vt's stream `Handler.resize`,
  which upstream wrote assuming a resize ends the mode, reports the end of
  its render hold only when the mode is actually off afterwards. Exact edits
  also update the upstream tests and comments that expected resize to end the
  hold; the geometry and callback assertions remain in place.
- `0015-hold-frame-for-prompt-redraw.sh` — a resize erases the prompt the
  cursor is on so the shell can redraw it (`clearPromptForRedraw`), and the
  renderer used to present that erased grid for the frames it took the shell
  to answer SIGWINCH: the last line blinked on every resize. The screen now
  records that a *visible* prompt was erased (`Screen.prompt_redraw`, with
  the number of non-empty input cells on the whole prompt before erasure), and the renderer
  keeps its last frame while that is set, as it does for synchronized
  output. OSC 133 B says the shell's prompt is drawn — and nothing about the
  input after it, which the shell draws next, possibly in another write —
  so the hold then continues until at least the erased input cells are back
  on that prompt or a 50 ms grace passes (a shell may legitimately draw
  less: zsh drops RPROMPT from a line it no longer fits). Each visible erase
  advances a terminal-owned generation, so a new redraw restarts that grace
  even if resize and B both arrive between frames; the overall deadline stays.
  For `redraw=last`, a line containing only input can complete as soon as the
  input count is restored, without another B. Retained input rows count on
  both sides of the comparison, so they cannot stand in for erased input.
  An incomplete continuation remains bounded by the overall deadline.
  OSC 133 C and a
  full reset end it outright. The renderer bounds the wait itself, in
  `updateFrame`: 500 ms from the first frame it held, never extended by the
  resizes that keep arriving during a drag, and released whichever path set
  the flag — termio's coalesced resize, DECCOLM, mode 3 — since all of them
  reach `Screen.resize`. It schedules its own wake for the deadline through
  `animationWake`, the hook the render thread already polls after every
  frame; there is no termio timer to arm and nothing to forget. The
  terminal state is untouched — the erase still happens, so reflow leaves
  no stale prompt behind; `redraw=0` was the alternative and gives that up.
- `0016-maccatalyst.sh` — Zig 0.16 made Mac Catalyst its own OS tag
  (`aarch64-maccatalyst`; 0.15 spelled it `aarch64-ios-macabi`, os `.ios`
  + abi `.macabi`), so the `.ios` arms stopped covering it. `.maccatalyst`
  takes the iOS arm wherever 0012 gives `.visionos` one, `osVersionMin`
  gets a 15.0 arm (Catalyst versions follow iOS), `MetallibStep` compiles
  the shaders as for device iOS (what the 0.15 fall-through shipped), and
  `apple-sdk/native_link.zig` learns the macOS SDK + `-macabi` triple
  (marker `LIBGHOSTTY_SPM_MACCATALYST_PATCH`; runs after 0012).
- `0017-zig-pkg-apple-targets.sh` — libxev (the event loop Ghostty pulls in)
  gets `.maccatalyst` beside its Darwin arms; without it a Catalyst build
  stops at "no default backend for this target". Packages are unpacked by
  0.16 under `<source>/zig-pkg/`, so the script runs `zig build --fetch=all`
  when libxev is missing (a fresh clone; it is a lazy dependency, which the
  default `needed` mode skips) and edits the unpacked copy, which later
  builds leave alone; `build-ghostty.sh` hands `apply-patches.sh` the
  build's `ZIG_GLOBAL_CACHE_DIR` so the fetch reuses its cache. It also
  fixes two of aro's Apple `TARGET_OS_*` conditionals, which must match what
  the SDK's own `TargetConditionals.h` defines: `TARGET_OS_IPHONE` gets
  `.maccatalyst` and `.visionos` (Apple sets it for both), `TARGET_OS_IOS`
  gets `.maccatalyst`. With them 0, CoreFoundation never declares
  `CFTypeRef` / `CFAttributedStringRef`, every CoreText prototype fails to
  parse, and aro panics on the invalid type (`TypeStore.zig`
  `.invalid => unreachable`) — maccatalyst, xros and xrsimulator all died at
  `CTLine.h:140` that way while macos, ios and the ios simulator built. Both
  edits are anchored to the macro name and skipped when the arm is already
  present, so an aro that grows its own gets no duplicate. It also carried a
  `.visionos` arm for aro's Apple version macro until aro `f97cdfc3` grew
  its own — a bare insert with no such guard, which is how it once produced
  `duplicate switch value` on all ten targets. Since the pin at `3c47ca15`
  (the first built by the vancluever translate-c) it also fixes aro's
  `isBlocksSupported`: Zig 0.16's `Os.isAtLeast` answers `false`, not
  `null`, for another OS tag, so aro's macOS-version question returned
  "unsupported" for ios, the simulator, maccatalyst and visionos, and every
  one of those slices died translating CoreGraphics (`CGPath.h:392: error:
  blocks are not enabled`) — the 2026-09-14 and 09-21 build failures.

- `0018-cancel-closing-surface-mailbox.patch` — surface teardown marks the
  surface closing before joining producer threads. Forever surface-message
  pushes retry with a 10 ms cancellable wait, preserving lossless delivery
  while open and releasing owned messages after close begins. This breaks the
  app-thread-join / producer-wait cycle when the app mailbox is full. Payloads
  left for a destroyed surface or at app shutdown are released as well.

Dropped once upstream carried them: `0014-free-text-signature.patch`
(`ghostty_surface_free_text` taking the surface, upstream `4803d58b`). A
patch that only "already applies" is a liability — the day its context
moves, both the forward and the reverse check fail on a change we no
longer need — so delete one as soon as the pin includes it.

## Current goal

This patch workflow exists so we can carry the host-managed IO work required
for sandboxed iOS, macOS, and Mac Catalyst integration without hiding upstream
modifications inside ad-hoc build script edits. The pin (`Ghostty.ref`)
moves to upstream main's head every week (weekly.yml), so the stack is
exercised against a fresh tree each time: a variant that stops validating
fails that week's build, and the fix is a new `-vN` variant selected by an
upstream marker in `apply-patches.sh`, never an edit to the older one.
